# Ai-surveillance
Project by Team SPEC

Introduction: Detect activities of a person in real time video stream.

Algorithm: YOLO


FRAMEWORK- 
We are using Opencv deep learning framework which is easy to install and use. It has advantage over darknet as it is compatible with all devices.

DATASET-
Dataset: For the dataset of traning our model for various activities and object recognition, we will use " COCO " Dataset ( Common Objects in Context). This database includes hundreds of thousands of images with millions of already labeled objects for training. Finally, we shall use townset dataset to train our model for real time streaming.
